Things to know before deciding to use linux:

- [Distributions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/List_of_Linux_distributions), often refered as `distros`, are different versions of the Linux operating system, each tailored with its own set of features and customization. There are [a lot of them](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg/920px-Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg.png). Some populat distributions includes Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch and Gentoo.

- Commands. There are a lot of linux commands you should be familiar with. You should use those commands inside a terminal. Examples:

  - `ls` to list all files
  - `cd` to change the current working directory
  - `pwd` to show the current working directory
  - `cp` to copy files
  - `mv` to move files
  - `rm` to move files
  - `chmod` to change file permissions
  - `chown` to change the file's ownership
  - `grep` to search text in files
  - `cat` to show contents of a file

  Never run a command that you do not understand. Linux gives you full power to run commands, therefore you should be very careful about what you type.

- **_[For Advanced Users]_** Desktop Enviroments. You will need to manually install on some Linux Distros, such as Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. However, some Linux Distros allows you to choose a Desktop Enviroment, such as Ubuntu, which offers [normal ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and [kubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours).
