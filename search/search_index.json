Fun fact: he also made the version control tool <code>git</code>. Github and Codeberg are two softwares that host Git repositories.</p> <p>Things to know before deciding to use linux:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Distributions, often refered as <code>distros</code>, are different versions of the Linux operating system, each tailored with its own set of features and customization. There are a lot of them. Some populat distributions includes Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch and Gentoo.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commands. There are a lot of linux commands you should be familiar with. You should use those commands inside a terminal. Examples:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ls</code> to list all files</p> </li> <li><code>cd</code> to change the current working directory</li> <li><code>pwd</code> to show the current working directory</li> <li><code>cp</code> to copy files</li> <li><code>mv</code> to move files</li> <li><code>rm</code> to move files</li> <li><code>chmod</code> to change file permissions</li> <li><code>chown</code> to change the file's ownership</li> <li><code>grep</code> to search text in files</li> <li><code>cat</code> to show contents of a file</li> </ul>    Never run a command that you do not understand. Linux gives you full power to run commands, therefore you should be very careful about what you type.  <ul> <li>[For Advanced Users] Desktop Enviroments. You will need to manually install on some Linux Distros, such as Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. However, some Linux Distros allows you to choose a Desktop Enviroment, such as Ubuntu, which offers normal ubuntu and kubuntu.</li> </ul>"}]}
